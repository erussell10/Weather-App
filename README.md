# Weather-App
This is a basic code for a weather application that both provides current weather and forecasts weather out 5 days. 

The idea was not my own; it was provided to me as an assignment through my coursework at Skillcrush. However, through this
exercise, I was able to explore the various weather gems available to Ruby, including Yahoo Weather, weather, and weatherboy, 
which was the final gem chosen for this app. 

In choosing my own gem, this assignment allowed me to explore the benefits of each and exposed me to the process related to 
choosing the best gem for your project. In this case, I ended up choosing weatherboy because it had a great read_me file 
available that allowed me to easily understand the methods built into the gem. Further, it had a really simplified forecasting
method, which cut down on the amount of code I had to write to achieve the assignment outcome. I did not find similar teaching 
aids in the other two apps; even if they did have the same methods, the lack of easy-to-find and easy-to-read supporting docs 
turned me off of them before I could get much further into my coding project.

My only main concern was my seeming inability to turn the weather conditions into sentence case. I attempted using various
versions of .humanize but often had an "undefined method" error returned. This is, perhaps, and area of improvement for this
app.
